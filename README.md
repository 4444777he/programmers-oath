An oath for programmers, adapted from the Hippocratic Oath

**As a programmer, I swear to fulfill these stories:**

I will only undertake honest and moral work. I will stand firm against any requirement that exploits or harms people.

I will respect the learnings of those programmers who came before me, and share my learnings with those to come.

I will remember that programming is art as well as science, and that warmth, empathy and understanding may outweigh a clever algorithm or technical argument.

I will not be ashamed to say "I don't know", and I will ask for help when I am stuck.

I will respect the privacy of my users, for their information is not disclosed to me that the world may know.

I will tread most carefully in matters of life or death. Above all, I must not play at God.

I will remember that I do not write code for computers, but for people.

I will consider the possible consequences of my code and actions. I will respect the difficulties of both social and technical problems.

I will be dilligent and take pride in my work. I will practice pragmatism above idealism.

I will recognize that I can and will be wrong, sometimes. I will keep an open mind, and listen to others carefully and with respect.

Inspired by the [Modern Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#Modern_version) and [the Obligation of the Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer's_Ring#The_Obligation_of_The_Engineer).

This is a very early draft. My intention is to collaboratively write an oath that could be spread in my community. I think the importance of considering the impact of our actions as coders is huge, and not talked about enough.

A longer term goal would be to convince some companies to only hire developers who have taken the oath.
